# ClipFlow ðŸ“‹âš¡

**ClipFlow** is an online clipboard built with Next.js that allows users to store and retrieve text using a unique `refid`. If you visit [`https://clipflow.vercel.app`](https://clipflow.vercel.app), a new `refid` will be automatically generated, and you will be redirected to it.

## ðŸš§ Branch Under Development

ClipFlow is currently in active development, with new features and improvements being added. Stay tuned for updates!
